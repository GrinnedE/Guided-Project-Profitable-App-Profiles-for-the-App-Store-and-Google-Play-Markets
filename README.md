# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

In this guided project we were looking for a free app profile, targeted at an english-speaking audience. We analyzed ~7,000 App Store apps and ~10,000 Google Play apps with a goal of finding a profitable app profile that would work well on both markets. It required us to collect the relevant data, clean the data sets and analyze the cleared data. 

We came to the conclusion that 'Books' genre provided a good balance and chance of success on both markets. As for our app idea, we came up with two ideas. The first one was to make an app about Hindu holy books, since apps related to The Bible or Quran achieved good results and a big audience. The second idea was a wiki app that would contain guides on the most popular games. Apps like that achieved pretty good results on App Store, but had a small presence on Google Play, providing us with almost no competition. This app idea requires more work, but provides us more developement opportunities and a more constant stream of users than the first idea. Both apps would require the user to spend a significant amount of time, making it well-suited for making money from ads.
